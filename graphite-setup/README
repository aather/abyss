Abyss agents depends on following components:

- graphite server to store metrics 
- grafana dashboards for visualization 
- apache web server for http requestes  

setup-graphite.sh script will set up graphite, grafana, and apache server on a single server.

graphite carbon servers are configured to use port: 7405 7406,7407.
grafana server runs on port: 7401. 
apache server listens on standard http port: 80

To confirm the setup successful , run "$sudo netstat -ltpn". It should show python (carbon) processes, http (apache) and grafna servers are listening to configured ports. Make sure your systems have all these ingress ports open in firewall or security group.
