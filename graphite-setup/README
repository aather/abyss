Abyss agents relies on following components to work:

- graphite server to store metrics 
- grafana dashboards for visualization 
- apache web server for http requestes  
- elasticsearch for storing dashboard. 

setup-graphite.sh script can help with the task of setting up all these services on a single server.

graphite carbon servers are configured to use port: 7405 (for other graphite services open port: 7406,7407)
grafana is client side application (java script) that runs in the browser. grafana can save dashboards on the cloud instance that has elastic search running and allow ingress traffic to elasticsearch ports. 
elastic search (ES) is configured to use port: 7410 7411. 
apache server listens on standard http port: 80

To confirm the setup was successfully executed, run "$sudo netstat -ltpn". It should show python processes, ES, and apache are listening to correct ports. Make sure your cloud instance has these ingress ports open in security group .  
netstat -ltpn
